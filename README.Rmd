## A Wicked Awesome Title
Woo!! This is the section of text under the title in my README.Rmd!

## CODE ALERT! THERE'S CODE HERE!
Here is a little bit of R code displaying the numbers 1 to 5 and their values multiplied by 2!

```{r}
x <- c(1:5)
y <- c(2*x)
xy_dataframe <- data.frame(
  x_col = x,
  y_col = y
)
xy_dataframe
```

## Evil Plotting Lies Ahead
Here is a plot of x and y from the previous bit of code!

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=xy_dataframe, mapping=aes(x = x_col, y = y_col)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title="A straight line with slope = 2")
```
